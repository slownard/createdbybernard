            <h3>My Faith</h3>

            <p>
                Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior. I had an encounter with Him when I was in high school and decided to give my life up to Him. This Christian walk has definetely had its' ups and downs but it was until recently that I have been able to say that He is my everything.

            <h3>Ministry</h3>


            <p>
                In November 2022, my friends and I decided to continually meet on tuesday nights to be vulnerable with each other and to pray. For awhile it was just three of us gathered in an apartment and as months passed, we would become a group of 15 to 20 men who were just hungry for God. From what started as friends gathering, blossomed into a men's discipleship group.

                Apart from the Men's group, I serve at my local church, Living Word Church located in Union, NJ. It is an honor and a joy to play a role in the discipleship of the youth in the church, primarily middle school kids.

                About one to two times a month, a group of young adults and myself go to the streets of Newark to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ and pray for the community. We play worship music at a local park and serve drinks as well.
